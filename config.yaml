# config.yaml

# arXiv search queries. Each query is run separately, results are deduplicated.
# These define the scope of "NetML" — tune as the field evolves.
# All queries restricted to CS/EE categories to avoid astrophysics, chemistry, etc.

# Relevant arXiv categories for filtering
# cs.NI = Networking, cs.LG = Machine Learning, cs.CR = Security
# cs.DC = Distributed Computing, cs.AI = AI, cs.SY/eess.SY = Systems & Control

queries:
  # Author-tagged papers (authors add #NetML to their arXiv Comments field)
  - 'co:NetML'

  # ML/DL papers in the networking category
  - 'cat:cs.NI AND ("machine learning" OR "deep learning" OR "neural network")'

  # Traffic analysis & classification (must be in CS categories)
  - '(cat:cs.NI OR cat:cs.CR OR cat:cs.LG) AND ("network traffic" OR "traffic classification") AND ("machine learning" OR "deep learning")'

  # Internet / network measurement + ML
  - '(cat:cs.NI OR cat:cs.CR) AND ("internet measurement" OR "network measurement") AND ("machine learning" OR "deep learning")'

  # Congestion control / transport + ML
  - '(cat:cs.NI OR cat:cs.LG) AND ("congestion control" OR "transport protocol") AND ("reinforcement learning" OR "deep learning")'

  # SDN / network management + ML

  - '(cat:cs.CR OR cat:cs.NI) AND ("intrusion detection" OR "network anomaly" OR "malware detection" OR "DDoS") AND ("machine learning" OR "deep learning")'
