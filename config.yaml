# arXiv search queries. Each query is run separately, results are deduplicated.
# These define the scope of "NetML" — tune as the field evolves.
queries:
  # ML/DL papers in the networking category
  - 'cat:cs.NI AND ("machine learning" OR "deep learning" OR "neural network")'

  # Traffic analysis & classification
  - '("network traffic" OR "traffic classification" OR "traffic analysis") AND ("machine learning" OR "deep learning" OR "transformer")'

  # Internet / network measurement + ML
  - '("internet measurement" OR "network measurement") AND ("machine learning" OR "deep learning")'

  # Congestion control / transport + ML
  - '("congestion control" OR "transport protocol") AND ("reinforcement learning" OR "deep learning")'

  # SDN / network management + ML
  - '("software defined networking" OR "network management" OR "network operations") AND ("machine learning" OR "deep learning")'

  # Network security + ML
  - '("intrusion detection" OR "anomaly detection" OR "network security") AND ("machine learning" OR "deep learning" OR "neural network")'

  # Generative models for networking
  - '("network traffic" OR "packet" OR "netflow") AND ("generative" OR "diffusion model" OR "GAN" OR "large language model")'

  # DNS / CDN / Web + ML
  - '("DNS" OR "CDN" OR "web performance") AND ("machine learning" OR "deep learning")'

  # IoT + ML networking
  - '("IoT" OR "internet of things") AND ("network" OR "traffic") AND ("machine learning" OR "federated learning")'

  # Wireless / cellular + ML
