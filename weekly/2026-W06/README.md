### Predictive-State Communication: Innovation Coding and Reconciliation under Delay

**Authors:** Ozgur Ercetin, Mohaned Chraiti
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10542v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10542v1)

Shannon theory models communication as the reliable transfer of symbol sequences, with performance governed by capacity and rate-distortion limits. When both endpoints possess strong predictors -- as in modern large language models and related generative priors -- literal symbol transport is no longer the only operational regime. We propose predictive-state communication (PSC), in which the transmitter and receiver maintain an explicit shared predictive state, and the physical channel is used primarily to convey innovations, i.e., corrective information that reconciles the receiver's provisional trajectory with the transmitter's realized trajectory. This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality.

### To Reconfigure or Not to Reconfigure: Optimizing All-to-All Collectives in Circuit-Switched Photonic Interconnects

**Authors:** Anchengcheng Zhou, Vamsi Addanki, Maria Apostolaki
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10468v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10468v1)

All-to-all collective communication is a core primitive in distributed machine learning and high-performance computing. At the server scale, the communication demands of these workloads are increasingly outstripping the bandwidth and energy limits of electrical interconnects, driving a growing interest in photonic interconnects. However, leveraging these interconnects for all-to-all communication is nontrivial. The core challenge lies in jointly optimizing a sequence of topologies and flow schedules, reconfiguring only when the transmission savings from traversing shorter paths outweigh the reconfiguration cost. Yet the search space of this joint optimization is enormous. Existing work sidesteps this challenge by making unrealistic assumptions on reconfiguration costs so that it is never or always worthwhile to reconfigure. In this paper, we show that any candidate sequence of topologies and flow schedules can be expressed as a sum of adjacency matrices and their powers. This abstraction captures the entire solution space and yields a lower bound on all-to-all completion time. Building on this formulation, we identify a family of topology sequences with strong symmetry and high expansion that admits bandwidth-efficient schedules, which our algorithm constructs with low computational overhead. Together, these insights allow us to efficiently construct near-optimal solutions, effectively avoiding enumeration of the combinatorial design space. Evaluation shows that our approach reduces all-to-all completion time by up to 44% on average across a wide range of network parameters, message sizes and workload types.

### SplitCom: Communication-efficient Split Federated Fine-tuning of LLMs via Temporal Compression

**Authors:** Tao Li, Yulin Tang, Yiyang Song, Cong Wu, Xihui Liu, Pan Li, Xianhao Chen
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10564v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10564v1)

Federated fine-tuning of on-device large language models (LLMs) mitigates privacy concerns by preventing raw data sharing. However, the intensive computational and memory demands pose significant challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, split federated learning (SFL) emerges as a promising solution that partitions the model into lightweight client-side and compute-intensive server-side sub-models, thus offloading the primary training workload to a powerful server. Nevertheless, high-dimensional activation exchanges in SFL lead to excessive communication overhead. To overcome this, we propose SplitCom, a communication-efficient SFL framework for LLMs that exploits temporal redundancy in activations across consecutive training epochs. Inspired by video compression, the core innovation of our framework lies in selective activation uploading only when a noticeable deviation from previous epochs occurs. To balance communication efficiency and learning performance, we introduce two adaptive threshold control schemes based on 1) bang-bang control or 2) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we implement dimensionality reduction techniques to alleviate client-side memory requirements. Furthermore, we extend SplitCom to the U-shape architecture, ensuring the server never accesses clients' labels. Extensive simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate that SplitCom reduces uplink communication costs by up to 98.6\,\% in its standard configuration and total communication costs by up to 95.8\,\% in its U-shape variant without noticeably compromising model performance.

### Hybrid Responsible AI-Stochastic Approach for SLA Compliance in Multivendor 6G Networks

**Authors:** Emanuel Figetakis, Ahmed Refaey Hussein
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09841v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09841v1)

The convergence of AI and 6G network automation introduces new challenges in maintaining transparency, fairness, and accountability across multivendor management systems. Although closed-loop AI orchestration improves adaptability and self-optimization, it also creates a responsibility gap, where violations of SLAs cannot be causally attributed to specific agents or vendors. This paper presents a hybrid responsible AI-stochastic learning framework that embeds fairness, robustness, and auditability directly into the network control loop. The framework integrates RAI games with stochastic optimization, enabling dynamic adversarial reweighting and probabilistic exploration across heterogeneous vendor domains. An RAAP continuously records AI-driven decision trajectories and produces dual accountability reports: user-level SLA summaries and operator-level responsibility analytics. Experimental evaluations on synthetic two-class multigroup datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model improves the accuracy of the worst group by up to 10.5\%. Specifically, hybrid RAI achieved a WGAcc of 60.5\% and an AvgAcc of 72.7\%, outperforming traditional RAI-GA (50.0\%) and ERM (21.5\%). The audit mechanism successfully traced 99\% simulated SLA violations to the AI entities responsible, producing both vendor and agent-level accountability indices. These results confirm that the proposed hybrid approach enhances fairness and robustness as well as establishes a concrete accountability framework for autonomous SLA assurance in multivendor 6G networks.

### PACC: Protocol-Aware Cross-Layer Compression for Compact Network Traffic Representation

**Authors:** Zhaochen Guo, Tianyufei Zhou, Honghao Wang, Ronghua Li, Shinan Liu
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08331v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08331v1)

Network traffic classification is a core primitive for network security and management, yet it is increasingly challenged by pervasive encryption and evolving protocols. A central bottleneck is representation: hand-crafted flow statistics are efficient but often too lossy, raw-bit encodings can be accurate but are costly, and recent pre-trained embeddings provide transfer but frequently flatten the protocol stack and entangle signals across layers. We observe that real traffic contains substantial redundancy both across network layers and within each layer; existing paradigms do not explicitly identify and remove this redundancy, leading to wasted capacity, shortcut learning, and degraded generalization. To address this, we propose PACC, a redundancy-aware, layer-aware representation framework. PACC treats the protocol stack as multi-view inputs and learns compact layer-wise projections that remain faithful to each layer while explicitly factorizing representations into shared (cross-layer) and private (layer-specific) components. We operationalize these goals with a joint objective that preserves layer-specific information via reconstruction, captures shared structure via contrastive mutual-information learning, and maximizes task-relevant information via supervised losses, yielding compact latents suitable for efficient inference. Across datasets covering encrypted application classification, IoT device identification, and intrusion detection, PACC consistently outperforms feature-engineered and raw-bit baselines. On encrypted subsets, it achieves up to a 12.9% accuracy improvement over nPrint. PACC matches or surpasses strong foundation-model baselines. At the same time, it improves end-to-end efficiency by up to 3.16x.

### NeuroScaler: Towards Energy-Optimal Autoscaling for Container-Based Services

**Authors:** Alisson O. Chaves, Rodrigo Moreira, Larissa F. Rodrigues Moreira, Joao Correia, David Santos, Rui Silva, Tiago Barros, Daniel Corujo, Miguel Rocha, Flavio de Oliveira Silva
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08191v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08191v1)

Future networks must meet stringent requirements while operating within tight energy and carbon constraints. Current autoscaling mechanisms remain workload-centric and infrastructure-siloed, and are largely unaware of their environmental impact. We present NeuroScaler, an AI-native, energy-efficient, and carbon-aware orchestrator for green cloud and edge networks. NeuroScaler aggregates multi-tier telemetry, from Power Distribution Units (PDUs) through bare-metal servers to virtualized infrastructure with containers managed by Kubernetes, using distinct energy and computing metrics at each tier. It supports several machine learning pipelines that link load, performance, and power. Within this unified observability layer, a model-predictive control policy optimizes energy use while meeting service-level objectives. In a real testbed with production-grade servers supporting real services, NeuroScaler reduces energy consumption by 34.68% compared to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) while maintaining target latency.

### Trajectory-Aware Multi-RIS Activation and Configuration: A Riemannian Diffusion Method

**Authors:** Kaining Wang, Bo Yang, Yusheng Lei, Zhibo Li, Zhiwen Yu, Xuelin Cao, Bin Guo, George C. Alexandropoulos, Dusit Niyato, Mérouane Debbah, Zhu Han
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07937v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07937v1)

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer a low-cost, energy-efficient means for enhancing wireless coverage. Yet, their inherently programmable reflections may unintentionally amplify interference, particularly in large-scale, multi-RIS-enabled mobile communication scenarios where dense user mobility and frequent line-of-sight overlaps can severely degrade the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel generative multi-RIS control framework that jointly optimizes the ON/OFF activation patterns of multiple RISs in the smart wireless environment and the phase configurations of the activated RISs based on predictions of multi-user trajectories and interference patterns. We specially design a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network, enriched with speed and heading features, to forecast multi-user trajectories, thereby enabling reconstruction of future channel state information. To overcome the highly nonconvex nature of the multi-RIS control problem, we develop a Riemannian diffusion model on the torus to generate geometry-consistent phase-configuration, where the reverse diffusion process is dynamically guided by reinforcement learning. We then rigorously derive the optimal ON/OFF states of the metasurfaces by comparing predicted achievable rates under RIS activation and deactivation conditions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 30\% SINR improvement over learning-based control and up to 44\% gain compared with the RIS always-on scheme, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across different transmit powers, RIS configurations, and interference densities.

### Makespan Minimization in Split Learning: From Theory to Practice

**Authors:** Robert Ganian, Fionn Mc Inerney, Dimitra Tsigkari
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06693v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.06693v1)

Split learning recently emerged as a solution for distributed machine learning with heterogeneous IoT devices, where clients can offload part of their training to computationally-powerful helpers. The core challenge in split learning is to minimize the training time by jointly devising the client-helper assignment and the schedule of tasks at the helpers. We first study the model where each helper has a memory cardinality constraint on how many clients it may be assigned, which represents the case of homogeneous tasks. Through complexity theory, we rule out exact polynomial-time algorithms and approximation schemes even for highly restricted instances of this problem. We complement these negative results with a non-trivial polynomial-time 5-approximation algorithm. Building on this, we then focus on the more general heterogeneous task setting considered by Tirana et al. [INFOCOM 2024], where helpers have memory capacity constraints and clients have variable memory costs. In this case, we prove that, unless P=NP, the problem cannot admit a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for any approximation factor. However, by adapting our aforementioned 5-approximation algorithm, we develop a novel heuristic for the heterogeneous task setting and show that it outperforms heuristics from prior works through extensive experiments.

### Talk Like a Packet: Rethinking Network Traffic Analysis with Transformer Foundation Models

**Authors:** Samara Mayhoub, Chuan Heng Foh, Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi, Mohammad Shojafar, Rahim Tafazolli
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06636v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.06636v1)

Inspired by the success of Transformer-based models in natural language processing, this paper investigates their potential as foundation models for network traffic analysis. We propose a unified pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline for traffic foundation models. Through fine-tuning, we demonstrate the generalizability of the traffic foundation models in various downstream tasks, including traffic classification, traffic characteristic prediction, and traffic generation. We also compare against non-foundation baselines, demonstrating that the foundation-model backbones achieve improved performance. Moreover, we categorize existing models based on their architecture, input modality, and pre-training strategy. Our findings show that these models can effectively learn traffic representations and perform well with limited labeled datasets, highlighting their potential in future intelligent network analysis systems.

### Data analysis of cloud virtualization experiments

**Authors:** Pedro R. X. do Carmo, Eduardo Freitas, Assis T. de Oliveira Filho, Judith Kelner, Djamel Sadok
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05792v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05792v1)

The cloud computing paradigm underlines data center and telecommunication infrastructure design. Heavily leveraging virtualization, it slices hardware and software resources into smaller software units for greater flexibility of manipulation. Given the considerable benefits, several virtualization forms, with varying processing and communication overheads, emerged, including Full Virtualization and OS Virtualization. As a result, predicting packet throughput at the data plane turns out to be more challenging due to the additional virtualization overhead located at CPU, I/O, and network resources. This research presents a dataset of active network measurements data collected while varying various network parameters, including CPU affinity, frequency of echo packet injection, type of virtual network driver, use of CPU, I/O, or network load, and the number of concurrent VMs. The virtualization technologies used in the study include KVM, LXC, and Docker. The work examines their impact on a key network metric, namely, end-to-end latency. Also, it builds data models to evaluate the impact of a cloud computing environment on packet round-trip time. To explore data visualization, the dataset was submitted to pre-processing, correlation analysis, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. In addition, this paper provides a brief analysis of the dataset, demonstrating its use in developing machine learning-based systems for administrator decision-making.

### SecureScan: An AI-Driven Multi-Layer Framework for Malware and Phishing Detection Using Logistic Regression and Threat Intelligence Integration

**Authors:** Rumman Firdos, Aman Dangi
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10750v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10750v1)

The growing sophistication of modern malware and phishing campaigns has diminished the effectiveness of traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems. This work presents SecureScan, an AI-driven, triple-layer detection framework that integrates logistic regression-based classification, heuristic analysis, and external threat intelligence via the VirusTotal API for comprehensive triage of URLs, file hashes, and binaries. The proposed architecture prioritizes efficiency by filtering known threats through heuristics, classifying uncertain samples using machine learning, and validating borderline cases with third-party intelligence. On benchmark datasets, SecureScan achieves 93.1 percent accuracy with balanced precision (0.87) and recall (0.92), demonstrating strong generalization and reduced overfitting through threshold-based decision calibration. A calibrated threshold and gray-zone logic (0.45-0.55) were introduced to minimize false positives and enhance real-world stability. Experimental results indicate that a lightweight statistical model, when augmented with calibrated verification and external intelligence, can achieve reliability and performance comparable to more complex deep learning systems.

### Beyond Permissions: An Empirical Static Analysis of Privacy and Security Risks in Children-Oriented and General-Audience Mobile Apps for Gaming

**Authors:** Bakheet Aljedaani
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10877v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10877v1)

Mobile gaming applications (apps) have become increasingly pervasive, including a growing number of games designed for children. Despite their popularity, these apps often integrate complex analytics, advertising, and attribution infrastructures that may introduce privacy and security risks. Existing research has primarily focused on tracking behaviors or monetization models, leaving configuration-level privacy exposure and children-oriented apps underexplored. In this study, we conducted a comparative static analysis of Android mobile games to investigate privacy and security risks beyond permission usage. The analysis follows a three-phase methodology comprising (i) designing study protocol, (ii) Android Package Kit (APK) collection and static inspection, and (iii) data analysis. We examined permissions, manifest-level configuration properties (e.g., backup settings, cleartext network traffic, and exported components), and embedded third-party Software Development Kit (SDK) ecosystems across children-oriented and general-audience mobile games. The extracted indicators are synthesized into qualitative privacy-risk categories to support comparative reporting. The results showed that while children-oriented games often request fewer permissions, they frequently exhibit configuration-level risks and embed third-party tracking SDKs similar to general-audience games. Architectural and configuration decisions play a critical role in shaping privacy risks, particularly for apps targeting children. This study contributes a holistic static assessment of privacy exposure in mobile games and provides actionable insights for developers, platform providers, and researchers seeking to improve privacy-by-design practices in mobile applications.

### Empirical Evaluation of SMOTE in Android Malware Detection with Machine Learning: Challenges and Performance in CICMalDroid 2020

**Authors:** Diego Ferreira Duarte, Andre Augusto Bortoli
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08744v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08744v1)

Malware, malicious software designed to damage computer systems and perpetrate scams, is proliferating at an alarming rate, with thousands of new threats emerging daily. Android devices, prevalent in smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, and IoTs, represent a vast attack surface, making malware detection crucial. Although advanced analysis techniques exist, Machine Learning (ML) emerges as a promising tool to automate and accelerate the discovery of these threats. This work tests ML algorithms in detecting malicious code from dynamic execution characteristics. For this purpose, the CICMalDroid2020 dataset, composed of dynamically obtained Android malware behavior samples, was used with the algorithms XGBoost, Naıve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Random Forest (RF). The study focused on empirically evaluating the impact of the SMOTE technique, used to mitigate class imbalance in the data, on the performance of these models. The results indicate that, in 75% of the tested configurations, the application of SMOTE led to performance degradation or only marginal improvements, with an average loss of 6.14 percentage points. Tree-based algorithms, such as XGBoost and Random Forest, consistently outperformed the others, achieving weighted recall above 94%. It is inferred that SMOTE, although widely used, did not prove beneficial for Android malware detection in the CICMalDroid2020 dataset, possibly due to the complexity and sparsity of dynamic characteristics or the nature of malicious relationships. This work highlights the robustness of tree-ensemble models, such as XGBoost, and suggests that algorithmic data balancing approaches may be more effective than generating synthetic instances in certain cybersecurity scenarios

### Evasion of IoT Malware Detection via Dummy Code Injection

**Authors:** Sahar Zargarzadeh, Mohammad Islam
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08170v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08170v1)

The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized connectivity by linking billions of devices worldwide. However, this rapid expansion has also introduced severe security vulnerabilities, making IoT devices attractive targets for malware such as the Mirai botnet. Power side-channel analysis has recently emerged as a promising technique for detecting malware activity based on device power consumption patterns. However, the resilience of such detection systems under adversarial manipulation remains underexplored.
  This work presents a novel adversarial strategy against power side-channel-based malware detection. By injecting structured dummy code into the scanning phase of the Mirai botnet, we dynamically perturb power signatures to evade AI/ML-based anomaly detection without disrupting core functionality. Our approach systematically analyzes the trade-offs between stealthiness, execution overhead, and evasion effectiveness across multiple state-of-the-art models for side-channel analysis, using a custom dataset collected from smartphones of diverse manufacturers. Experimental results show that our adversarial modifications achieve an average attack success rate of 75.2\%, revealing practical vulnerabilities in power-based intrusion detection frameworks.

### ACORN-IDS: Adaptive Continual Novelty Detection for Intrusion Detection Systems

**Authors:** Sean Fuhrman, Onat Gungor, Tajana Rosing
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07291v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07291v1)

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) must maintain reliable detection performance under rapidly evolving benign traffic patterns and the continual emergence of cyberattacks, including zero-day threats with no labeled data available. However, most machine learning-based IDS approaches either assume static data distributions or rely on labeled attack samples, substantially limiting their applicability in real-world deployments. This setting naturally motivates continual novelty detection, which enables IDS models to incrementally adapt to non-stationary data streams without labeled attack data. In this work, we introduce ACORN-IDS, an adaptive continual novelty detection framework that learns exclusively from normal data while exploiting the inherent structure of an evolving unlabeled data stream. ACORN-IDS integrates a continual feature extractor, trained using reconstruction and metric learning objectives with clustering-based pseudo-labels, alongside a PCA-based reconstruction module for anomaly scoring. This design allows ACORN-IDS to continuously adapt to distributional shifts in both benign and malicious traffic. We conduct an extensive evaluation of ACORN-IDS on five realistic intrusion datasets under two continual learning scenarios: (i) Evolving Attacks and (ii) Evolving Normal and Attack Distributions. ACORN-IDS achieves, on average, a 62% improvement in F1-score and a 58% improvement in zero-day attack detection over the state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning baseline. It also outperforms existing state-of-the-art novelty detection approaches while exhibiting near-zero forgetting and imposing minimal inference overhead. These results demonstrate that ACORN-IDS offers a practical, label-efficient solution for building adaptive and robust IDS in dynamic, real-world environments. We plan to release the code upon acceptance.

### Hydra: Robust Hardware-Assisted Malware Detection

**Authors:** Eli Propp, Seyed Majid Zahedi
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07240v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07240v1)

Malware detection using Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) offers a promising, low-overhead approach for monitoring program behavior. However, a fundamental architectural constraint, that only a limited number of hardware events can be monitored concurrently, creates a significant bottleneck, leading to detection blind spots. Prior work has primarily focused on optimizing machine learning models for a single, statically chosen event set, or on ensembling models over the same feature set. We argue that robustness requires diversifying not only the models, but also the underlying feature sets (i.e., the monitored hardware events) in order to capture a broader spectrum of program behavior. This observation motivates the following research question: Can detection performance be improved by trading temporal granularity for broader coverage, via the strategic scheduling of different feature sets over time? To answer this question, we propose Hydra, a novel detection mechanism that partitions execution traces into time slices and learns an effective schedule of feature sets and corresponding classifiers for deployment. By cycling through complementary feature sets, Hydra mitigates the limitations of a fixed monitoring perspective. Our experimental evaluation shows that Hydra significantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-feature-set baselines, achieving a 19.32% improvement in F1 score and a 60.23% reduction in false positive rate. These results underscore the importance of feature-set diversity and establish strategic multi-feature-set scheduling as an effective principle for robust, hardware-assisted malware detection.

### AlertBERT: A noise-robust alert grouping framework for simultaneous cyber attacks

**Authors:** Lukas Karner, Max Landauer, Markus Wurzenberger, Florian Skopik
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06534v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.06534v1)

Automated detection of cyber attacks is a critical capability to counteract the growing volume and sophistication of cyber attacks. However, the high numbers of security alerts issued by intrusion detection systems lead to alert fatigue among analysts working in security operations centres (SOC), which in turn causes slow reaction time and incorrect decision making. Alert grouping, which refers to clustering of security alerts according to their underlying causes, can significantly reduce the number of distinct items analysts have to consider. Unfortunately, conventional time-based alert grouping solutions are unsuitable for large scale computer networks characterised by high levels of false positive alerts and simultaneously occurring attacks. To address these limitations, we propose AlertBERT, a self-supervised framework designed to group alerts from isolated or concurrent attacks in noisy environments. Thereby, our open-source implementation of AlertBERT leverages masked-language-models and density-based clustering to support both real-time or forensic operation. To evaluate our framework, we further introduce a novel data augmentation method that enables flexible control over noise levels and simulates concurrent attack occurrences. Based on the data sets generated through this method, we demonstrate that AlertBERT consistently outperforms conventional time-based grouping techniques, achieving superior accuracy in identifying correct alert groups.

### Empirical Analysis of Adversarial Robustness and Explainability Drift in Cybersecurity Classifiers

**Authors:** Mona Rajhans, Vishal Khawarey
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06395v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.06395v1)

Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly deployed in cybersecurity applications such as phishing detection and network intrusion prevention. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations small, deliberate input modifications that can degrade detection accuracy and compromise interpretability. This paper presents an empirical study of adversarial robustness and explainability drift across two cybersecurity domains phishing URL classification and network intrusion detection. We evaluate the impact of L (infinity) bounded Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) perturbations on model accuracy and introduce a quantitative metric, the Robustness Index (RI), defined as the area under the accuracy perturbation curve. Gradient based feature sensitivity and SHAP based attribution drift analyses reveal which input features are most susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Experiments on the Phishing Websites and UNSW NB15 datasets show consistent robustness trends, with adversarial training improving RI by up to 9 percent while maintaining clean-data accuracy. These findings highlight the coupling between robustness and interpretability degradation and underscore the importance of quantitative evaluation in the design of trustworthy, AI-driven cybersecurity systems.

### Interpreting Manifolds and Graph Neural Embeddings from Internet of Things Traffic Flows

**Authors:** Enrique Feito-Casares, Francisco M. Melgarejo-Meseguer, Elena Casiraghi, Giorgio Valentini, José-Luis Rojo-Álvarez
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05817v2) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05817v2)

The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has led to increasingly complex and heterogeneous network topologies. Traditional network monitoring and visualization tools rely on aggregated metrics or static representations, which fail to capture the evolving relationships and structural dependencies between devices. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to learn from relational data, their internal representations often remain opaque and difficult to interpret for security-critical operations. Consequently, this work introduces an interpretable pipeline that generates directly visualizable low-dimensional representations by mapping high-dimensional embeddings onto a latent manifold. This projection enables the interpretable monitoring and interoperability of evolving network states, while integrated feature attribution techniques decode the specific characteristics shaping the manifold structure. The framework achieves a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection while also highlighting phenomena such as concept drift. Ultimately, the presented approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional GNN embeddings and human-understandable network behavior, offering new insights for network administrators and security analysts.

### Deep Learning for Contextualized NetFlow-Based Network Intrusion Detection: Methods, Data, Evaluation and Deployment

**Authors:** Abdelkader El Mahdaouy, Issam Ait Yahia, Soufiane Oualil, Ismail Berrada
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05594v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05594v1)

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have progressively shifted from signature-based techniques toward machine learning and, more recently, deep learning methods. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of encryption has reduced payload visibility, weakening inspection pipelines that depend on plaintext content and increasing reliance on flow-level telemetry such as NetFlow and IPFIX. Many current learning-based detectors still frame intrusion detection as per-flow classification, implicitly treating each flow record as an independent sample. This assumption is often violated in realistic attack campaigns, where evidence is distributed across multiple flows and hosts, spanning minutes to days through staged execution, beaconing, lateral movement, and exfiltration. This paper synthesizes recent research on context-aware deep learning for flow-based intrusion detection. We organize existing methods into a four-dimensional taxonomy covering temporal context, graph or relational context, multimodal context, and multi-resolution context. Beyond modeling, we emphasize rigorous evaluation and operational realism. We review common failure modes that can inflate reported results, including temporal leakage, data splitting, dataset design flaws, limited dataset diversity, and weak cross-dataset generalization. We also analyze practical constraints that shape deployability, such as streaming state management, memory growth, latency budgets, and model compression choices. Overall, the literature suggests that context can meaningfully improve detection when attacks induce measurable temporal or relational structure, but the magnitude and reliability of these gains depend strongly on rigorous, causal evaluation and on datasets that capture realistic diversity.

### FedPS: Federated data Preprocessing via aggregated Statistics

**Authors:** Xuefeng Xu, Graham Cormode
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10870v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10870v1)

Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple parties to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. However, before training, data must be preprocessed to address missing values, inconsistent formats, and heterogeneous feature scales. This preprocessing stage is critical for model performance but is largely overlooked in FL research. In practical FL systems, privacy constraints prohibit centralizing raw data, while communication efficiency introduces further challenges for distributed preprocessing. We introduce FedPS, a unified framework for federated data preprocessing based on aggregated statistics. FedPS leverages data-sketching techniques to efficiently summarize local datasets while preserving essential statistical information. Building on these summaries, we design federated algorithms for feature scaling, encoding, discretization, and missing-value imputation, and extend preprocessing-related models such as k-Means, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Bayesian Linear Regression to both horizontal and vertical FL settings. FedPS provides flexible, communication-efficient, and consistent preprocessing pipelines for practical FL deployments.

### LLM-FS: Zero-Shot Feature Selection for Effective and Interpretable Malware Detection

**Authors:** Naveen Gill, Ajvad Haneef K, Madhu Kumar S D
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09634v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09634v1)

Feature selection (FS) remains essential for building accurate and interpretable detection models, particularly in high-dimensional malware datasets. Conventional FS methods such as Extra Trees, Variance Threshold, Tree-based models, Chi-Squared tests, ANOVA, Random Selection, and Sequential Attention rely primarily on statistical heuristics or model-driven importance scores, often overlooking the semantic context of features. Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, MCC, and runtime. Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection achieves competitive performance with traditional FS methods while offering additional advantages in interpretability, stability, and reduced dependence on labeled data. These findings position zero-shot LLM-based FS as a promising alternative strategy for effective and interpretable malware detection, paving the way for knowledge-guided feature selection in security-critical applications

Data privacy and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are two important aspects for modern Machine Learning systems. To enhance data privacy, recent machine learning models have been designed as a Federated Learning (FL) system. On top of that, additional privacy layers can be added, via Differential Privacy (DP). On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability. So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model. The carried out performance assessment shows improvements of FEXT-DP in terms of a faster training, i.e., numbers of rounds, Mean Squared Error and explainability.

The Rashomon set captures the collection of models that achieve near-identical empirical performance yet may differ substantially in their decision boundaries. Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in FL.First, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local distribution.Second, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that all three proposed federated Rashomon set definitions offer valuable insights, enabling clients to deploy models that better align with their local data, fairness considerations, and practical requirements.

### DynamiQ: Accelerating Gradient Synchronization using Compressed Multi-hop All-reduce

Multi-hop all-reduce is the de facto backbone of large model training. As the training scale increases, the network often becomes a bottleneck, motivating reducing the volume of transmitted data. Accordingly, recent systems demonstrated significant acceleration of the training process using gradient quantization. However, these systems are not optimized for multi-hop aggregation, where entries are partially summed multiple times along their aggregation topology.
  This paper presents DynamiQ, a quantization framework that bridges the gap between quantization best practices and multi-hop aggregation. DynamiQ introduces novel techniques to better represent partial sums, co-designed with a decompress-accumulate-recompress fused kernel to facilitate fast execution.
  We extended PyTorch DDP to support DynamiQ over NCCL P2P, and across different LLMs, tasks, and scales, we demonstrate consistent improvement of up to 34.2% over the best among state-of-the-art methods such as Omni-Reduce, THC, and emerging standards such as MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8. Further, DynamiQ is the only evaluated method that consistently reaches near-baseline accuracy (e.g., 99.9% of the BF16 baseline) and does so while significantly accelerating the training.

### RIFLE: Robust Distillation-based FL for Deep Model Deployment on Resource-Constrained IoT Networks

Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized learning paradigm widely adopted in resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) environments. These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds. Notably, RIFLE reduces VGG19 training time from over 600 days to just 1.39 hours on typical IoT devices (0.3 GFLOPS), making deep learning practical in resource-constrained networks.

### ERIS: Enhancing Privacy and Communication Efficiency in Serverless Federated Learning

[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08617v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08617v1)

Scaling federated learning (FL) to billion-parameter models introduces critical trade-offs between communication efficiency, model accuracy, and privacy guarantees. Existing solutions often tackle these challenges in isolation, sacrificing accuracy or relying on costly cryptographic tools. We propose ERIS, a serverless FL framework that balances privacy and accuracy while eliminating the server bottleneck and distributing the communication load. ERIS combines a model partitioning strategy, distributing aggregation across multiple client-side aggregators, with a distributed shifted gradient compression mechanism. We theoretically prove that ERIS (i) converges at the same rate as FedAvg under standard assumptions, and (ii) bounds mutual information leakage inversely with the number of aggregators, enabling strong privacy guarantees with no accuracy degradation. Experiments across image and text tasks, including large language models, confirm that ERIS achieves FedAvg-level accuracy while substantially reducing communication cost and improving robustness to membership inference and reconstruction attacks, without relying on heavy cryptography or noise injection.

### Federated Learning with Profile Mapping under Distribution Shifts and Drifts

Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across clients without sharing raw data, but its performance degrades under real-world data heterogeneity. Existing methods often fail to address distribution shift across clients and distribution drift over time, or they rely on unrealistic assumptions such as known number of client clusters and data heterogeneity types, which limits their generalizability. We introduce Feroma, a novel FL framework that explicitly handles both distribution shift and drift without relying on client or cluster identity. Feroma builds on client distribution profiles-compact, privacy-preserving representations of local data-that guide model aggregation and test-time model assignment through adaptive similarity-based weighting. This design allows Feroma to dynamically select aggregation strategies during training, ranging from clustered to personalized, and deploy suitable models to unseen, and unlabeled test clients without retraining, online adaptation, or prior knowledge on clients' data. Extensive experiments show that compared to 10 state-of-the-art methods, Feroma improves performance and stability under dynamic data heterogeneity conditions-an average accuracy gain of up to 12 percentage points over the best baselines across 6 benchmarks-while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg. These results highlight that distribution-profile-based aggregation offers a practical path toward robust FL under both data distribution shifts and drifts.

### VertCoHiRF: Decentralized Vertical Clustering Beyond k-means

Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative analysis across parties holding complementary feature views of the same samples, yet existing approaches are largely restricted to distributed variants of $k$-means, requiring centralized coordination or the exchange of feature-dependent numerical statistics, and exhibiting limited robustness under heterogeneous views or adversarial behavior. We introduce VertCoHiRF, a fully decentralized framework for vertical federated clustering based on structural consensus across heterogeneous views, allowing each agent to apply a base clustering method adapted to its local feature space in a peer-to-peer manner. Rather than exchanging feature-dependent statistics or relying on noise injection for privacy, agents cluster their local views independently and reconcile their proposals through identifier-level consensus. Consensus is achieved via decentralized ordinal ranking to select representative medoids, progressively inducing a shared hierarchical clustering across agents. Communication is limited to sample identifiers, cluster labels, and ordinal rankings, providing privacy by design while supporting overlapping feature partitions and heterogeneous local clustering methods, and yielding an interpretable shared Cluster Fusion Hierarchy (CFH) that captures cross-view agreement at multiple resolutions.We analyze communication complexity and robustness, and experiments demonstrate competitive clustering performance in vertical federated settings.

### Generalizable and Robust Beam Prediction for 6G Networks: An Deep-Learning Framework with Positioning Feature Fusion

**Authors:** Yanliang Jin, Yunfan Li, Jiang Jun, Yuan Gao, Shengli Liu, Jianbo Du, Zhaohui Yang, Shugong Xu
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09685v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09685v1)

Beamforming (BF) is essential for enhancing system capacity in fifth generation (5G) and beyond wireless networks, yet exhaustive beam training in ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems incurs substantial overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning based framework that leverages position-aware features to improve beam prediction accuracy while reducing training costs. The proposed approach uses spatial coordinate labels to supervise a position extraction branch and integrates the resulting representations with beam-domain features through a feature fusion module. A dual-branch RegNet architecture is adopted to jointly learn location related and communication features for beam prediction. Two fusion strategies, namely adaptive fusion and adversarial fusion, are introduced to enable efficient feature integration. The proposed framework is evaluated on datasets generated by the DeepMIMO simulator across four urban scenarios at 3.5 GHz following 3GPP specifications, where both reference signal received power and user equipment location information are available. Simulation results under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms traditional baselines and achieves more accurate and robust beam prediction by effectively incorporating positioning information.

**Authors:** Peng Yi, Ying-Chang Liang
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09615v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09615v1)

Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a key enabler for next-generation wireless communication systems, offering powerful tools to cope with the increasing complexity, dynamics, and heterogeneity of modern wireless environments. To illustrate the role and impact of AI in wireless communications, this paper takes collaborative spectrum sensing (CSS) in cognitive and intelligent wireless networks as a representative application and surveys recent advances from an AI perspective. We first introduce the fundamentals of CSS, including the general framework, classical detector design, and fusion strategies. Then, we present an overview of the state-of-the-art research on AI-driven CSS, classified into three categories: discriminative deep learning (DL) models, generative DL models, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Furthermore, we explore semantic communication (SemCom) as a promising solution for CSS, in which task-oriented representations are exchanged to reduce reporting overhead while preserving decision-critical information. Finally, we discuss limitations, open challenges, and future research directions at the intersection of AI and wireless communication.

This tutorial-style overview article examines the fundamental principles and methods of robustness, using wireless sensing and communication (WSC) as the narrative and exemplifying framework. First, we formalize the conceptual and mathematical foundations of robustness, highlighting the interpretations and relations across robust statistics, optimization, and machine learning. Key techniques, such as robust estimation and testing, distributionally robust optimization, and regularized and adversary training, are investigated. Together, the costs of robustness in system design, for example, the compromised nominal performances and the extra computational burdens, are discussed. Second, we review recent robust signal processing solutions for WSC that address model mismatch, data scarcity, adversarial perturbation, and distributional shift. Specific applications include robust ranging-based localization, modality sensing, channel estimation, receive combining, waveform design, and federated learning. Through this effort, we aim to introduce the classical developments and recent advances in robustness theory to the general signal processing community, exemplifying how robust statistical, optimization, and machine learning approaches can address the uncertainties inherent in WSC systems.

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology has the potential to significantly enhance the spectral efficiency (SE) of 6G wireless networks. However, practical deployment remains constrained by challenges in accurate channel estimation and control optimization under dynamic conditions. This paper presents a foundation model-aided hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (FM-HDRL) framework designed for joint beamforming and phase-shift optimization in RIS-assisted wireless networks. To implement this, we first fine-tune a pre-trained large wireless model (LWM) to translate raw channel data into low-dimensional, context-aware channel state information (CSI) embeddings. Next, these embeddings are combined with user location information and blockage status to select the optimal communication path. The resulting features are then fed into an HDRL model, assumed to be implemented at a centralized controller, which jointly optimizes the base station (BS) beamforming vectors and the RIS phase-shift configurations to maximize SE. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FM-HDRL framework consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of convergence speed, spectral efficiency, and scalability. According to the simulation results, our proposed method improves 7.82% SE compared to the FM-aided deep reinforcement learning (FM-DRL) approach and a substantial enhancement of about 48.66% relative to the beam sweeping approach.

### LocDreamer: World Model-Based Learning for Joint Indoor Tracking and Anchor Scheduling

[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08204v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08204v1)

Accurate, resource-efficient localization and tracking enables numerous location-aware services in next-generation wireless networks. However, existing machine learning-based methods often require large labeled datasets while overlooking spectrum and energy efficiencies. To fill this gap, we propose LocDreamer, a world model (WM)-based framework for joint target tracking and scheduling of localization anchors. LocDreamer learns a WM that captures the latent representation of the target motion and localization environment, thereby generating synthetic measurements to imagine arbitrary anchor deployments. These measurements enable imagination-driven training of both the tracking model and the reinforcement learning (RL)-based anchor scheduler that activates only the most informative anchors, which significantly reduce energy and signaling costs while preserving high tracking accuracy. Experiments on a real-world indoor dataset demonstrate that LocDreamer substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, outperforming conventional Bayesian filter with random scheduling by 37% in tracking accuracy, and achieving 86% of the accuracy of same model trained directly on real data.

### Consensus Protocols for Entanglement-Aware Scheduling in Distributed Quantum Neural Networks

**Authors:** Kuan-Cheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Mahdi Chehimi, Felix Burt, Kin K. Leung
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06847v1) · [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.06847v1)

The realization of distributed quantum neural networks (DQNNs) over quantum internet infrastructures faces fundamental challenges arising from the fragile nature of entanglement and the demanding synchronization requirements of distributed learning. We introduce a Consensus-Entanglement-Aware Scheduling (CEAS) framework that co-designs quantum consensus protocols with adaptive entanglement management to enable robust synchronous training across distributed quantum processors. CEAS integrates fidelity-weighted aggregation, in which parameter updates are weighted by quantum Fisher information to suppress noisy contributions, with decoherence-aware entanglement scheduling that treats Bell pairs as perishable resources subject to exponential decay. The framework incorporates quantum-authenticated Byzantine fault tolerance, ensuring security against malicious nodes while maintaining compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) constraints. Our theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees under heterogeneous noise conditions, while numerical simulations demonstrate that CEAS maintains 10-15 percentage points higher accuracy compared to entanglement-oblivious baselines under coordinated Byzantine attacks, achieving 90 percent Bell-pair utilization despite coherence time limitations. This work provides a foundational architecture for scalable distributed quantum machine learning, bridging quantum networking, distributed optimization, and early fault-tolerant quantum computation.
